<p>22.01.2015: a new book, <a href="https://hyphenpress.co.uk/products/books/978-0-907259-50-3"><em>The real thing: essays on making in the modern world</em></a> by Tanya Harrod published by Hyphen Press launched at a packed event in the impressive main hall of the <a href="http://www.artworkersguild.org/booking/">Art Workers&#8217; Guild</a> in London&#8217;s Bloomsbury. Tanya spoke eloquently about her motivation for putting together within one volume, thirty-years worth of essays on craft, art and design, their overlaps and differences.</p>
<p>23.01.2015: Ten years in the making, Robert Bradbrook&#8217;s new film, the animationÂ <a href="http://www.bradfilms.co.uk/deadair/index.html"><em>Dead Air</em></a> was unveiled in three showings at the British Film Institute&#8217;s Stephen Street screening rooms. Speaking enthusiastically about the help he received from various quarters he endorsed the views of one of the film&#8217;s protagonists, Laura, who stands as an optimistic embracer of evolution and change against stasis and conservatism.</p>
