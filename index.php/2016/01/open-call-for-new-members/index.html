<p>Workplace Co-operative 115 provides a collegiate and friendly environment for a diverse range of individuals engaged in making, designing, consulting, writing, film-making and publishing.</p>
<p>Units are generously proportioned, and shared with others; workspaces are typically 8 square metres. Affordable rents — between £120 and £220 per month, depending on size — include all bills, use of kitchen, and 24-hour access. Applicants should expect to take a participative role in the co-op and to have it as their main place of work.</p>
<p>Enquiries are currently being accepted. Please write to us telling us about yourself and the work you do.</p>
