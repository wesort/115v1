				<p>Post-Christmas, we held our annual film-clip night amidst beer and snacks. The theme this time was ‘work’. Choices ranged from the serious to the slapstick with documentary, animation, and mainstream all making an appearance. Here are the films from which the extracts were taken:</p>
<ul style="font-size: 0.7em; line-height: 1.4em">
<li style="margin-top: 1em"> Robin chose, and in his absence we showed <em>Man of Marble</em>, directed by Andrzej Wajda, 1976<br />
Lisa showed <em>Slacker</em>, directed by Richard Linklater, 1991<br />
Dan showed <em>Manufactured Landscapes</em>, directed by Jennifer Baichwal with Edward Burtynsky, 2006<br />
Robert J acted out <em>Saving Mr Banks</em>, directed by John Lee Hancock, 2013<br />
