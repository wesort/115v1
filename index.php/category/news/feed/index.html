			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-size: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1em;">Christmas Party 2014</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1em">On 17 December last year, 28 of us – members plus ones – gathered for our annual Christmas meal, made for the first time on site.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2021" style="max-width:100%; float: left;" title="115_party_201412_lamb" src="http://www.115.org.uk/115/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/115_party_201412_lamb2-300x225.jpg" alt="115_party_201412_lamb" /><br />
The double-height space of unit 3, recently vacated and awaiting its new incarnation as a workshop-cum-office, became, with hastily assembled benches and an assortment of tables, a temporary staff canteen. Much effort was made: we nibbled on toasted almonds and black olives while plates of buttered sourdough with home-cured gravadlax, made by Simon, did the rounds. A whole spit-roast lamb, cooked over hot coals in the front courtyard since early afternoon was tended by Mike, Simon and Jack. Accompaniments included pungent salsa verde made by Jack and Jeannetta; fresh broad bean, fennel, tomato, cucumber, feta, dill and parsley salad made by Robert J and Peter; a warming aubergine pilaf was made by Dan. We drank two different kitchen-brewed beers made between November and December by Olly and labelled by Peter. Duncan lit brandy and poured it over three of his rich and fruity home-made Christmas puddings, while Jeannetta’s delicious mince pies were consumed with relish and appreciation.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Ben Edmonds of We Sort creates a new website for Jason Orton who's recent book was designed by Peter Brawne.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The photographer Jason Orton, last mentioned here in connection with the book <a href="http://thenewenglishlandscape.wordpress.com/about/" target="_blank"><em>The New English Landscape</em></a> which carries his images, text by <a href="http://www.worpole.net" target="_blank">Ken Worpole</a> and was designed by co-op member <a href="http://www.115.org.uk/index.php/members/peter-brawne-graphic-designer/" target="_self">Peter Brawne</a>, now has a new website. This was created by fellow member Ben Edmonds of <a href="http://www.wesort.co.uk/" target="_blank">We Sort</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1677" title="jasonorton-com_13" src="http://www.115.org.uk/115/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/jasonorton-com_13-1024x618.jpg" alt="jasonorton-com_13" /></p>
<p>Functioning largely as a portfolio of photos, the site appearance changes depending which sort of device — desk- or lap-top computer, tablet or mobile phone — it is viewed on. While fulfilling this need for a mutable appearance, Ben also achieved the aim of having a simple, pared-back look ensuring the viewer focuses on the photography.</p>
<p>View Jason&#8217;s site here: <a href="http://jasonorton.com/" target="_blank">jasonorton.com</a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One day last week <a href="http://greenroofshelters.co.uk/" target="_blank">Green Roof Shelters</a> installed covers for cycle parking in Bethnal Green.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-large wp-image-1661 aligncenter" src="http://www.115.org.uk/115/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/green-roof-shelters_derbyshire-street_01-1024x768.jpg" alt="Derbyshire Street, shelters by Green Roof Shelters" /></p>
<h6>(The cycle racks were to be installed next day by others!)</h6>
<p>This new ‘pocket park’ is to be used as an exemplar of sustainable urban drainage design. The aim of sustainable urban drainage is that rain water doesn’t run off roads and pavements into our overloaded city drains. Instead the rain is used on green roofs, or runs into planting beds, or simply soaks into water-permeable paving. All these methods, and more, are used in Derbyshire Street Pocket Park. The shelters also provide lots of habitat for birds and beneficial pollinating insects.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.themakersofthings.co.uk/woodworker"><em>The Makers of Things</em></a> is a short documentary series (currently four parts) and a one-off newspaper about the <a title="Society for Model and Experimental Engineers" href="http://www.sm-ee.co.uk/" target="_blank">Society for Model and Experimental Engineers</a> (SMEE). Ben Edmonds of We Sort was involved, creating a website for the project. The films, each about four minutes long, show a woodworker, a model engineer, a &#8216;problem solver&#8217;, and one is about the SMEE itself.</p>
<p><img class="size-large wp-image-1504 alignnone" style="border: 0px;" title="The Makers of Things" src="http://www.115.org.uk/115/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/we-sort_tmot_01-1024x768.jpg" alt="The Makers of Things" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<ul style="font-size: 0.7em; line-height: 1.4em">
<li style="margin-top: 1em"> <em>The SMEE is a sprawling organisation with members all over the world. Their common tools and methods mask a huge array of interests and skills, from experimental tinkerers to woodworkers and librarians, all brought together under the roof of their South London headquarters. Established in the UK in 1898 by Percival Marshall, the Society has survived two world wars as well as the introduction of technology barely dreamed about at the beginning of the twentieth century. It now has hundreds of members from across the world, united by their passion for making and creating. </em></li>
