			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Friday 30 September we held an evening of discussion on the theme of measurement. This was prompted by the campaign of our friend <a href="http://www.michaelmarriott.com/">Michael Marriott</a> to abolish the centimetre and to <a href="http://www.millimetreswork.com/millimetres.html">use only millimetres</a> (and metres) for measurement. We gathered in the atrium at 115 to debate this and other issues in measurement.<br />
<img src="http://www.115.org.uk/115/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/measurement_2016_22.jpeg" alt="measurement_2016_2" title="measurement_2016_2" width="640" height="480" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2381" /><br />
Michael started the proceedings with powerful arguments for his case, saying that the centimetre was an unnecessary and unhelpful unit. He stressed that he was not against using feet and inches – despite the fact that the inch plays much the same role as the centimetre. When it came to a vote, his proposal to abolish centimetres was easily carried.<br />
Robin Kinross looked at measurement in typography, focusing on how type could be measured in word-processing software. He outlined a system in which type sizes are related to linespaces (or ‘leading’) and which could avoid the whole bedevilled issue of how and in what units to measure type. Adobe, Apple, Microsoft – take notice!<br />
Following up a manifesto statement of 20 years ago, Dan Monck talked about how the size of buildings can relate to the ways in which they are designed. Previously he had suggested that drawing constraints could provide a healthy limitation on the size of buildings, but now there are no obvious limits beyond those of manufacture and construction. He suggested a new ‘dogma’: that the size of a building should be related to the number of people who would inhabit it. He illustrated this by asking us to all join hands and extend our arms to form a maximum length …<br />
Lucy Bristow then spoke about measurement in film making. From her experience as a camera operator she demonstrated how a focus puller would do the job, tape measure in hand.<br />
On the walls and in the display cases we had assembled a fine collection of measures and rules, and other documents of measurement.<br />
The talks and the disccussion were accompanied by pizzas made in a small oven in the front courtyard, and London-brewed beer.</p>

<p>Last month we rolled up our sleeves and gave the building its annual clean. The idea is to reach the parts that we don’t expect to be touched by the person who comes to clean here for a couple of hours every week. These parts include the front and back courtyards, awkward spots in the atrium space, and, most spectacularly, the glass top to the atrium. The afternoon session was rounded off at a drinks party in the Bull &#038; Gate, convened to celebrate the engagement of Ben and his partner Sophie.</p>

<p>22.01.2015: a new book, <a href="https://hyphenpress.co.uk/products/books/978-0-907259-50-3"><em>The real thing: essays on making in the modern world</em></a> by Tanya Harrod published by Hyphen Press launched at a packed event in the impressive main hall of the <a href="http://www.artworkersguild.org/booking/">Art Workers&#8217; Guild</a> in London&#8217;s Bloomsbury.

<p>Jason Orton and Ken Worpole&#8217;s <em>The New English Landscape</em>, published this month, makes a substantial contribution to debates about landscape and politics in the UK. Worpole&#8217;s muscular text is juxtaposed with Orton&#8217;s lucid photographs. The whole is brought together and embodied as a book, designed and typeset at 115 by Peter Brawne of <a href="http://www.115.org.uk/index.php/members/peter-brawne-graphic-designer">Matter</a>. In the spirit of what we do here, the book is published and distributed by Ken Worpole himself. This has allowed the writer, photographer, and designer to have full control of what they were doing – in collaboration with the printer Cassochrome, a family firm in Belgium. <em>The New English Landscape</em> can be bought from <a href="http://www.worpole.net/">Ken Worpole&#8217;s website</a>. (It is not for sale through the all-powerful megastore Amazon, which nevertheless claims to be able to sell this item.) More details and discussion are <a href="http://thenewenglishlandscape.wordpress.com/">here</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On 31 July we went on our approximately-annual walk around a neighbourhood in London. Last time (21 October 2011) it was Fitzrovia. We thought that we should now explore the patch to the west: Marylebone Village. <img src="http://www.115.org.uk/115/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/marylebone_aqms.jpg" alt="marylebone_aqms" title="marylebone_aqms" width="300" height="225" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1490" /> Turning our backs on Madame Tussauds we looked across Marylebone Road to Dan Monck’s choice: the <a href="http://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/networks/site-info?site_id=MY1">air quality monitoring station</a> – a structure you only see if you know it’s there (<a href="http://www.swarch.co.uk/projects/air-quality-monitoring-station/info/">Sarah Wigglesworth Architects, 2011</a>). We walked on to Grotto Passage, just off Paddington Street, where Robert Bradbrook told the story of the shell-encrusted grotto there in the eighteenth century and the present ‘Ragged and Industrial Schools’ building (1860) that replaced it. We then stopped for drinks at the King’s Head, Westmoreland Street, before looking across the road at the <a href="http://www.uclh.org/OurServices/OurHospitals/HH/Pages/Home.aspx">Heart Hospital</a> (picked by Peter Brawne and Robin Kinross): a jewel in the crown of the NHS. Then to Marylebone Lane, whose bends, Aileen Harvey explained, followed the course of the river underground – the Tyburn – whose rushing sounds we were able to hear under manholes. One branch of this river enters the Thames at Pimlico, which suggests where we will walk next year. We finished the evening with a fish supper in the Golden Hind on Marylebone Lane.</p>
