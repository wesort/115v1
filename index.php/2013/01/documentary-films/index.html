				<p>Just before Christmas we held our annual film-clip night. The theme was ‘documentary’. Choices ranged quite widely over the terrain of factual film and managed to encompass both the sublime (Humphrey Jennings) and the more-or-less absurd (Harold Baim). Wildly varied directorial approaches showed that ‘documentary’ is a large field. Here are the films from which the extracts were taken:</p>
<ul style="font-size: 0.7em; line-height: 1.4em">
