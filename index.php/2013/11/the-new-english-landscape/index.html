<p>Jason Orton and Ken Worpole&#8217;s <em>The New English Landscape</em>, published this month, makes a substantial contribution to debates about landscape and politics in the UK. Worpole&#8217;s muscular text is juxtaposed with Orton&#8217;s lucid photographs. The whole is brought together and embodied as a book, designed and typeset at 115 by Peter Brawne of <a href="../../../members/peter-brawne-graphic-designer.1.html">Matter</a>. In the spirit of what we do here, the book is published and distributed by Ken Worpole himself. This has allowed the writer, photographer, and designer to have full control of what they were doing â€“ in collaboration with the printer Cassochrome, a family firm in Belgium. <em>The New English Landscape</em> can be bought from <a href="http://www.worpole.net/">Ken Worpole&#8217;s website</a>. (It is not for sale through the all-powerful megastore Amazon, which nevertheless claims to be able to sell this item.) More details and discussion are <a href="http://thenewenglishlandscape.wordpress.com/">here</a>.</p>
