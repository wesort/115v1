			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Friday 30 September we held an evening of discussion on the theme of measurement. This was prompted by the campaign of our friend <a href="http://www.michaelmarriott.com/">Michael Marriott</a> to abolish the centimetre and to <a href="http://www.millimetreswork.com/millimetres.html">use only millimetres</a> (and metres) for measurement. We gathered in the atrium at 115 to debate this and other issues in measurement.<br />
<img src="http://www.115.org.uk/115/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/measurement_2016_22.jpeg" alt="measurement_2016_2" title="measurement_2016_2" width="640" height="480" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2381" /><br />
Michael started the proceedings with powerful arguments for his case, saying that the centimetre was an unnecessary and unhelpful unit. He stressed that he was not against using feet and inches – despite the fact that the inch plays much the same role as the centimetre. When it came to a vote, his proposal to abolish centimetres was easily carried.<br />
Robin Kinross looked at measurement in typography, focusing on how type could be measured in word-processing software. He outlined a system in which type sizes are related to linespaces (or ‘leading’) and which could avoid the whole bedevilled issue of how and in what units to measure type. Adobe, Apple, Microsoft – take notice!<br />
Following up a manifesto statement of 20 years ago, Dan Monck talked about how the size of buildings can relate to the ways in which they are designed. Previously he had suggested that drawing constraints could provide a healthy limitation on the size of buildings, but now there are no obvious limits beyond those of manufacture and construction. He suggested a new ‘dogma’: that the size of a building should be related to the number of people who would inhabit it. He illustrated this by asking us to all join hands and extend our arms to form a maximum length …<br />
Lucy Bristow then spoke about measurement in film making. From her experience as a camera operator she demonstrated how a focus puller would do the job, tape measure in hand.<br />
On the walls and in the display cases we had assembled a fine collection of measures and rules, and other documents of measurement.<br />
The talks and the disccussion were accompanied by pizzas made in a small oven in the front courtyard, and London-brewed beer.</p>

In it, paella with squid, prawns, mussels and chorizo simmered slowly. As it cooked, we ate finely cut slices of Jamón Ibérico, thick wedges of tortilla, salty padron peppers, tomato salad, almonds and olives.</p>
<p>Many hands made light work of preparation and later, the clearing up.<br />

<p>Last month we rolled up our sleeves and gave the building its annual clean. The idea is to reach the parts that we don’t expect to be touched by the person who comes to clean here for a couple of hours every week. These parts include the front and back courtyards, awkward spots in the atrium space, and, most spectacularly, the glass top to the atrium. The afternoon session was rounded off at a drinks party in the Bull &#038; Gate, convened to celebrate the engagement of Ben and his partner Sophie.</p>

<p>22.01.2015: a new book, <a href="https://hyphenpress.co.uk/products/books/978-0-907259-50-3"><em>The real thing: essays on making in the modern world</em></a> by Tanya Harrod published by Hyphen Press launched at a packed event in the impressive main hall of the <a href="http://www.artworkersguild.org/booking/">Art Workers&#8217; Guild</a> in London&#8217;s Bloomsbury. Tanya spoke eloquently about her motivation for putting together within one volume, thirty-years worth of essays on craft, art and design, their overlaps and differences.</p>
<p>23.01.2015: Ten years in the making, Robert Bradbrook&#8217;s new film, the animation <a href="http://www.bradfilms.co.uk/deadair/index.html"><em>Dead Air</em></a> was unveiled in three showings at the British Film Institute&#8217;s Stephen Street screening rooms. Speaking enthusiastically about the help he received from various quarters he endorsed the views of one of the film&#8217;s protagonists, Laura, who stands as an optimistic embracer of evolution and change against stasis and conservatism.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 1em">On 17 December last year, 28 of us – members plus ones – gathered for our annual Christmas meal, made for the first time on site.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2021" style="max-width:100%; float: left;" title="115_party_201412_lamb" src="http://www.115.org.uk/115/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/115_party_201412_lamb2-300x225.jpg" alt="115_party_201412_lamb" /><br />
The double-height space of unit 3, recently vacated and awaiting its new incarnation as a workshop-cum-office, became, with hastily assembled benches and an assortment of tables, a temporary staff canteen. Much effort was made: we nibbled on toasted almonds and black olives while plates of buttered sourdough with home-cured gravadlax, made by Simon, did the rounds. A whole spit-roast lamb, cooked over hot coals in the front courtyard since early afternoon was tended by Mike, Simon and Jack. Accompaniments included pungent salsa verde made by Jack and Jeannetta; fresh broad bean, fennel, tomato, cucumber, feta, dill and parsley salad made by Robert J and Peter; a warming aubergine pilaf was made by Dan. We drank two different kitchen-brewed beers made between November and December by Olly and labelled by Peter. Duncan lit brandy and poured it over three of his rich and fruity home-made Christmas puddings, while Jeannetta’s delicious mince pies were consumed with relish and appreciation.</p>
