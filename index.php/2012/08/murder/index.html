				<p>Robert Jones&#8217;s latest television drama, <em>Murder</em>, will be broadcast Sunday 26 August at 10pm on BBC2. It is directed by Birger Larsson, who is well known for directing the Danish series <em>The Killing</em>. <em>Murder</em> is set in Nottingham and has a novel narrative style in which the actors talk directly to camera. <em>The Guardian</em>â€™s TV and radio blog carries a piece written by Robert <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/aug/22/murder-first-person-television-script">here</a>.
